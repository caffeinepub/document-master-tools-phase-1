  "summary": "All-in-One Utility Platform: Phase 1 - Advanced Calculator Hub, Phase 2 - PDF Tools Module, Phase 3 - Advanced Image Tools Module with passport/government document photo makers, image compression, format conversion, background removal, and DPI adjustment, Phase 4 - SEO & Monetization Foundation with global SEO structure, AdSense-ready layout, performance optimization, and internal linking, Phase 5 - Advanced Resume Builder with Indian and International format templates. Phase 6 - Global Multi-Language System with 9 languages, language switcher in header, i18n structure, language-based URLs, hreflang tags, canonical tags, and lazy-loaded language files. Phase 7 - Performance & UI Optimization with code splitting, lazy loading, UI refinement, AdSense optimization layout, improved internal linking, and enhanced SEO structure. Phase 9 - Smart Document Fixer Upgrade with side-by-side Before/After preview, zoom/toggle/crop/rotate preview, Auto Photo Size Generator with government presets, auto features, and export options — all client-side only. Phase 9 Pro UI: Smart Document Fixer now has a freemium model (Free: 2 fixes/day, standard quality, watermark; Pro: unlimited, HD, A4 sheet, no watermark, multi-photo sheet) with Go Pro button, pricing modal (₹499/month, ₹3999/year), feature comparison table, PRO badge on card, lock icons and blur on premium features for free users — all simulated via localStorage, no login/backend/payment gateway. All other tools remain 100% free and unchanged.
