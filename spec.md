# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the duplicate upper footer section so only the "Document Master Tools" footer remains.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the first (upper) footer section from `Footer.tsx` entirely
- Retain only the lower footer section that starts with "Document Master Tools" branding, leaving all its content, links, copyright text, styling, and mobile responsiveness unchanged

**User-visible outcome:** The website displays a single footer section site-wide, beginning with "Document Master Tools," with no duplicate footer above it.
