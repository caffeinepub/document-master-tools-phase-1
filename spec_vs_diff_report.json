  "summary": "The diff implements several of the 15 requirements but leaves many partially or entirely unimplemented. Core infrastructure pieces (BackToHomeButton, PostDownloadNavigation, BatchFileQueue, useBatchProcessor, pageSizePresets, locale files, LanguageContext/Selector updates, BreadcrumbNavigation with JSON-LD, AIDocumentEnhancerPage, ProPricingModal update, HomePage Pro section, ImageToolsPage Pro section, App.tsx route) are present. However, most of the actual tool-page integrations are absent. REQ-154, REQ-155, REQ-156, REQ-159, REQ-160, REQ-164, and REQ-165 are either missing entirely or only partially covered.",
