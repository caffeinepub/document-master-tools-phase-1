  "summary": "The diff shows that Footer.tsx was modified. The visible content in the diff shows the footer starting with 'Document Master Tools' branding and containing Quick Links and Legal columns — which according to REQ-131 should be the RETAINED lower section. The removed section was supposed to contain Quick Links, Legal, About, copyright, and 'Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai'. However, since the diff is truncated, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the upper duplicate section was fully removed. The file-summaries.txt does not provide a clear description of what changed in Footer.tsx. Given the truncation, the implementation appears to align with REQ-131 — the footer now starts with Document Master Tools branding — but full verification is limited.",
