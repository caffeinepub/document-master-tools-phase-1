However, REQ-144 (16 PDF tools upgrade) shows no PDF tool component files modified in the diff. REQ-140 is missing TIFF format support. REQ-141 is missing interactive drag-handle crop UI. REQ-148 mobile responsiveness is partially unconfirmed. REQ-145, REQ-146, REQ-147 page files are not in the modified files list.",
