  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive Resume Builder module with 14 templates, multi-step form wizard, live preview, photo upload, color themes, auto-formatting, and PDF download. However, several requirements are missing: individual template route implementation, PDF generation logic, SEO integration, mobile responsiveness validation, HomePage integration, Header navigation update, and AdPlaceholder integration.",

      "id": "REQ-72",
      "requirement": "Template cards are clickable and lead to individual template builders",
      "reason": "ResumeBuilderPage shows template cards but the click handlers call onNavigate with page strings instead of template slugs. No evidence of routing to individual template builder pages.",
