  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of Phase 3 requirements. 16 image tool pages are created with basic structure, routing is added to App.tsx, and core image processing utilities exist. However, several requirements are partially implemented (DPI Changer, Image Cropper, Background Remover, WEBP Converter only show upload UI without full functionality), and critical features like Job Form Special Mode (REQ-46) and full SEO optimization with FAQs (REQ-48) are missing or incomplete. HomePage correctly shows 16 image tools organized into 3 categories, and Footer displays the updated copyright.",
